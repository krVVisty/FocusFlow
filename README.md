Reflection:

Problem Domain:Many students struggle to keep track of their assignments, deadlines, and study sessions. This app helps users manage their tasks and study efficiently.

The team consists of Adam, Aren and Callum.

Roles:
Front-End Development: Aren and Callum.
Back-End Development: Adam.

Front-End Development:
The Front-End Development side of the assignment went quite well in regards to the design and structure of the application. We managed to complete all of our TO-DO tasks we set on Monday. One of the biggest struggles was working out the git branches and trying to work them there was a few times where Manny, Joe or Bertie were called to help because code had been pushed on the main branch.There was a few errors trying to get the notes locally stored but they were very simple fixes. We tried adding a To-Do task list but couldn't implement it properly without it messing up the CSS design for the other elements we had previously added to the CSS file.

Back-End Development:
On Wednesday the work focused on establishing the backend infrastructure and connecting it securely to our Supabase database, laying the foundation for future frontend features.

Key Accomplishments:
Structured the project repository with clear separation: backend and Frontend.
Implemented the backend using Node.js and Express, with endpoints for tasks, calendar events, and user-specific notes.
Configured Supabase as our database solution, ensuring that the backend can securely retrieve and serve data.
Successfully deployed the backend on Render, allowing it to run continuously and be accessible via a public URL.
Established a workflow for collaborative development using Git branches and Pull Requests, preventing conflicts with ongoing frontend work.

Lessons Learned:
Proper handling of environment variables is crucial for secure and flexible deployments.
Git workflows, especially branching and rebasing, are essential to maintain a clean and synchronized repository when multiple contributors are involved.
Deploying to a cloud service like Render requires careful attention to folder structure and package.json configuration to ensure smooth builds.
