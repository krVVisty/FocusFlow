## Front-End Development

The front-end development went well regarding the design and structure of the application. We completed all the TO-DO tasks we set on Monday. One of the biggest challenges was managing Git branches; there were a few instances where help from Manny, Joe, or Bertie was needed because code had been pushed directly to the main branch.

We encountered minor issues with locally stored notes, but these were easy to fix. Additionally, we attempted to implement a To-Do task list, but it interfered with the existing CSS design and couldnâ€™t be integrated without adjustments.

## Back-End Development

### Monday

- Planning stage: Adam and Callum
- Created Trello Kanban board for task management
- Brainstormed project ideas and features
- Established a Discord channel for team communication
- Set up GitHub repository

### Tuesday

- Established the initial backend infrastructure
- Connected the backend securely to our Supabase database
- Laid the foundation for future frontend features

### Wednesday

- Structured the project repository with clear separation: `backend` and `Frontend`
- Implemented the backend using Node.js and Express, with endpoints for tasks, calendar events, and user-specific notes
- Configured Supabase as our database solution, ensuring secure retrieval and serving of data
- Successfully deployed the backend on Render, making it continuously accessible via a public URL
- Established a workflow for collaborative development using Git branches and Pull Requests to prevent conflicts with ongoing frontend work

### Key Accomplishments

- Proper handling of environment variables for secure and flexible deployments
- Maintaining a clean and synchronized repository with Git workflows (branching and rebasing) for multiple contributors
- Ensuring smooth builds on cloud services like Render by paying attention to folder structure and `package.json` configuration

### Lessons Learned

- Secure and flexible deployment relies on proper environment variable management
- Git workflows are essential to prevent conflicts and maintain code integrity
- Cloud deployment requires careful attention to project structure and configurations
